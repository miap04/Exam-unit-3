**First commit:**

On the first commit I installed the node fetch through npm


**Task**

*getTask function:*
When starting on the task I first imported the fetch from the installed node fetch, then i did a simple GET request to get the a response from the API

*askForClue function:*
Used the getTask function but swapped out 'start' for 'clue' in the request, didnt get any response from the API though

*postAnswer function:*
Used the framework provided from node fetch and the website, although it hasnt produced any response yet.
